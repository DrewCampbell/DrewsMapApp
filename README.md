Drews Map App 
This app displays a map of anywhere in the world.  The user can zoom in to get a more detailed view.  The user can zoom to a location by entering the latitude and logitude coordinates.  They can enter an address or a place name.  The user can also select to zoom to the location they are currently standing.
This user can also use this application to track their current location, displaying small icons on the map every ten seconds.  These click-able icons are set to display the elapsed time and the elevation.
Finally, this application can allow the user to mark specific locations on their map with unique icons.  These points are set by the user through voice recognition.  The user first must train the application to associate and spken set of words to a drawable icon.  The user can then use this training template to place their unique icons on their map.
Both time tracked and position tracked maps are available to be saved and opened to view in the future.
